## Explanatory Note: Determining the Use of Table 3 Additives in Foods Covered by Commodity Standards based on the Revised Approach

- -   GLYPH&lt;9&gt; a commodity standard covers the use of foods in food categories that are contained in the Annex to Table 3, then Table 3 If does not apply to the commodity standard.
- -GLYPH&lt;9&gt;All food additive permissions for foods covered by food categories listed in the Annex to Table 3 must be listed in Tables 1 and 2 of the GSFA.
- -GLYPH&lt;9&gt; If a commodity standard covers a food category that is not listed in the Annex to Table 3, then the user should refer to the 'References to Commodity Standards for GSFA Table 3 Additives' section of Table 3.
- -GLYPH&lt;9&gt; If the section specific to the commodity standard indicates that all Table 3 additives are permitted for use in foods covered by the standard, then any food additives listed in Table 3 may be used in foods covered by the standard.
- -GLYPH&lt;9&gt; If the text indicates that only Table 3 additives with specific functional classes may be used (e.g. acidity regulator), then any Table 3 additive listing the noted functional class in column 3 of Table 3 may be used in foods covered by the commodity standard.
- -	   If the text indicates that 'only certain Table 3 food additives (as indicated in Table 3)' are permitted for use in foods covered by the commodity standard, then the user may refer to column 5 of Table 3 where the commodity standard number will be listed for the particular Table 3 food additives that are permitted for use in the commodity standard.

## 01.6.2.1 Ripened Cheese, includes rind

1 This Section only lists commodity standards where the corresponding GSFA Food Category is not listed in the Annex to Table 3. Provisions for the use of specific Table 3 additives in commodity standards where the corresponding GSFA Food Category is listed in the Annex to Table 3 can be found in the corresponding Food Categories in Tables 1 and 2. Be aware that the process to align food-additive provisions in commodity standards with the GSFA is a work in progress, and as a result not all commodity standards are yet listed in this Section.
